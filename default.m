%% Main file for data analysis Mosquito Thesis project
% Author: Luc van den Boogaart

%Use this file to set the algorithm settings and the operation mode.

%% Operation modes:
%'standard': Run the full algorithm
%   recommended use: use default settings
%
%'segmentation': Only runs the segmentation part of the code. 
%   recommended use: to find initial segmentation thresholds. To quickly
%   visualize segmentation result use: showframe(framenumber)
%
%'plotting': Only runs the figure plotting algorithm
%   recommended use: set clearall to false
%
%'load_data': Only loads the image data and creates a datastore
%   recommended use: using datastore for other purposes

%NOTE: Custom operating modes can be added in the runtype.m script under
%\functions\Driver and Settings

%% Do you want to clear the workspace?

%% Data set selection

%For WINDOWS machines: Set drive selection to automatic or manual.
%   automatic: will try to locate the events.xlsx file. This will work only
%   when the file is located in the top folder of a drive, either internal or
%   external.
%   manual: specify the measurement day, run number, drive, and camera.
%   sampledata: use the sample dataset

selection = 'sampledata';

%For IOS/Linux systems drive selection must be adjusted by manually and by
%hand. For details see the read_data_v05.m function

        %Note that specifying an altfolder will overwrite the folder
        %selection algorithm, but the above parameters still need to be
        %filled out for the data loading algorithm to work.
